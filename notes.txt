Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on projects efficiently by managing different versions of files and merging changes seamlessly.


Key benefits of Git include:
- Branching allows developers to work on features independently without affecting the main codebase.
- Git maintains a complete history of all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions when needed.
